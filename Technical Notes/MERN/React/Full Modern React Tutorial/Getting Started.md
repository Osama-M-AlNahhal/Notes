# Create a react boilerplate
*this requires that nodejs is installed.*
- go to the project's folder, and execute the following command
```shell
npx create-react-app project-name
```

# Visual Studio Code



# Running on the browser
*in the root project folder, run the following script (already built-in with the boilerplate). *
```js
npm run start
```
