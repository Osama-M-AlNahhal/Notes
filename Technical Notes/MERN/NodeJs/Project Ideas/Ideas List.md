Tabletop games use dice: 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided. How could you create a random number generator that would generate a given number of dice, such as rolling 6d6 (six 6-sided dice) or 20d8 (twenty 8-sided dice)? Could you make it so that it has a clean GUI?

# Basic Users System

Another application that you can do for training is a Basic User System. It’s a basic project, but it will help you to practice very useful skills because the user is a part of almost every application. 

In this example, you will learn:  
 - how to set up the database and do migrations,  
 - how to create a new user by the registration,  
 - how to build login endpoint,  
 - how to authenticate user,  
 - how to get the user’s data.

In the case of registration and login, you should generate a JWT token for the user that will be returned from the API.

Besides that, remember to hash the password before you save it in the database.
