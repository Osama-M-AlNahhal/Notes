# NAC
*Network Access Control*

- umbrella term
- Authenticates users (and checks their devices), then determines their authorized actions.

**NAC Deals with 3 catagories of components:***
1. Access Requester (*AR, Supplicant, client*).
2. Policy Server.
3. Network Access Servers (*NAS, Media Gateway, Remote Access Server RAS, Policy Server*): may include its own authentication server or rely on the policy server to authenticate users.

**Common NAC Enforcement Methods:**
- IEEE 802.1X : occurs at the *Data Link* layer
- DHCP Management : occurs at the IP Layer (Network Layer)
- VLANs 
- Firewall

# EAP
*Extensible Authentication Protocol*

- Framework for the exchange of authentication information between client and authentication server.
- The basic EAP transport service is extended by using a specific authentication protocol/method

![[EAP Layered Context.png]]


## EAP Methods
**Commonly Supported EAP Methods:**
1. EAP-TLS
2. EAP-TTLS
3. EAP-GPSK
4. EAP-IKEv2


### EAP-TLS
- uses the handshake protocol in TLS, not its encryption method.
- Client and server authenticate each other using digital certificates.
- client generates pre-master secret key (*PMSK*) -> sends it encrypted with the server's PK -> client and server generate a secret key from (*PMSK*).

### EAP-TTLS
*EAP - Tunneled TLS*

- similar to TLS, but the server has a certificate to authenticate itself to the client first.
- Tunnel is established with a secret key, then used to continue the authentication using another EAP method.


### EAP-GPSK
*EAP - Generalized Pre-Shared Key*

- based on Pre-Shared key only (*no asymmetric keys*).
- Advantage: Efficient in message flows and computational costs.
- Disadvantage: requires the existance of a Pre-Shared key between each peer and the EAP server (*this is set up during the peer's registeration proccess with the server*).
- EAP Exchange requires a minimum of 4 messages.


### EAP-IKEv2
*EAP - Internet Key Exchange version 2*

- supports mutual authentication and session key establishment.

## EAP Protocol Exchange

**EAP Echange Components:**
1. EAP Peer : Client
2. EAP Authenticator : an access point or NAS (*needs authentication to allow access*)
3. EAP Authentication Server: authenticates client, and is typically a *Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server*.


**EAP Pass-through Mode:** (*Common*)
- Authentication Server authenticates the user, then based on that -> the authenticator decides to allow access or not
**(*Less Common*)**: 
- the authenticator also does the role of the authentication server, so only a client and an authenticator are involved in the EAP Exchange.



***HOW DOES THE EXCHANGE WORK?***
![[EAP Protocol Exchanges.png]]

![[EAP Message Flow in Pass-Through Mode.png]]
- before the *EAP-Request/Identity* there's a lower level call (using PPP or IEEE 802.1X) to establish the need for an EAP exchange.
- Right after the Authentication Server recieves the identity, it decides which EAP method to use, and send it in the next *EAP-Request/Auth*
- if the *EAP Peer* doesn't support the method, it responds with (*NAK*)

# IEEE 802.1X
*Port-based Network Access Control*

## Terminology
| EAP                   | IEEE 802.1X          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Peer                  | Supplicant           |
| Authenticator         | Network Access Point |
| Authentication Server | Authentication Server                     |

- before Authentication: 
| Channel | port type    | Status    |
| ------- | --- | --------- |
| Control |   uncontrolled  | unblocked |
| data    |   controlled  | blocked   |

- after Authentication: 
| Channel | port type  | Status    |
| ------- | --- | --------- |
| Control |  uncontrolled   | unblocked |
| data    | controlled    | unblocked |

- *ports are used to exchange PDUs (Protocol Data Units)*

----

## EAPOL
*EAP Over LAN* ^43a29f

- Operates at the Network Layer
- uses IEEE 802 LANs at the Link Layer (like Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

### EAPOL Packet/Frame Types
1. EAPOL-Start.
2. EAPOL-EAP: (Encapsulates EAP Requests).
3. EAPOL-Key: (For exchanging keys after Authentication).
4. EAPOL-Logoff.

## cloud computing reference architecture
![[Cloud Computing Reference Architecture.png]]

**Cloud Carrier:**
- a networking facility that provides connectivity and transport of cloud services between cloud consumers and CPs.
- can provide dedicated and secure connections between cloud consumers and CPs.


**Cloud Broker:**
- Cloud Broker Provides The Following Support Areas: 
	1. Service Intermediation: (value-added services: like *identity management, performance reporting, and enhanced security*).
	2. Service Aggregation: combining multiple cloud services to meet consumer needs.
	3. Service Arbitrage: similar to *Service Aggregation* (Except that a broker has the flexibility to choose services from multiple agencies).


**Cloud Auditor:**

## Data Protection in the Cloud

- ***NIST*'s Guidelines on Security and Privacy Issues**

- **Database environments used in cloud computing:**
	1. multi-instance model: provides a unique DBMS running on a virtual machine instance for each cloud subscriber, giving them complete control.
	2. multi-tenant model: provides a predefined environment for the cloud subscriber that is shared with other tenants (via tagging with subscriber identifiers).


- **Data must be secured while at rest, in transit, and in use**
	1. in transit: client employs encryption, server handles key management or other encryption-related work.
	2. in rest: client stores data encrypted in the cloud, without the CP having access to the keys (*inflexible*).
	3. 


## SecaaS
*Security as a Service*

- a package of security services offered by a service provider, it takes over the responsibility of providing security for the user.

- SecaaS categories of service (by *Cloud Security Allience*): 
	1. Identity and access management (IAM).
	2. Data loss prevention (DLP).
	3. Web security.
	4. Email security.
	5. Security assessments: (third-party audits of cloud services).
	6. Intrusion management: includes detection systems (IDS) and prevention systems (IPS).
		- *IDS: a set of automated tools designed to detect unauthorized access to a host system.*
	7. Security information and event management (SIEM): aggregates (via push or pull mechanisms) log and event data.
	8. Encryption.
	9. Business continuity and disaster recovery.
	10. Network security.
