# Decrease by a constant
## Insertion sort
*Time complexity: o(n^2) (avg = o(n)), Time complexity: o(1), stable*



## generating permutations & subsets



---

# Decrease by a constant factor
## Binary search & bisection method


## exponentiation by squaring



---

# Variable-size decrease
## Euclid's Algorithm
*for finding GCD in log(n) time complexity*

## Selection by partition
- find the k'th element from an unsorted array
- find the median (element that's at the middle of the array)

**Two ways for in-place partitioning :**
1. One-directional scan (Lomuto's partitioning algorithm).
2. Two-directional scan (Hoare's partitioning algorithm).
