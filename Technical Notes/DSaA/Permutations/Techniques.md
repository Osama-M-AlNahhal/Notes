# Johnson-Trotter Algorithm

mobile : greater than its immediate neighbor in the direction it is looking at.

>while (last permutation has a mobile element) 
>	1. find the largest mobile element (k)
>	2. swap k with the element it's pointing to.
>	3. reverse the direction of all elements > k
>	4. add new permutation to list.
