# TLS Protocols
*TLS is not a single protocol, but a layer of protocols relying on TCP/IP protocols*
![[TLS protocol stack.png]]
TLS Protocols: 
- Record Protocol: provide security to HTTP
- Handshake Protocol
- Change cipher spec Protocol
- Alert Protocol

- ***Heartbeat Protocol: defined in a different RFC***

## Handshake:
*parameters = content in the previous table in chart c*
![[TLS handshake protocol parameters.png]]

----
# shared master key generation
*48 byte secret for the session*
***2 Stages:***
1. pre_master_secret is exchanged
	1. RSA
	2. Diffe-hellman
2. master_key generated by both parties

---
# Generation of cryptographic parameters by master key
*by hashing the master key into a suffeciently large hash and dividing it for each parameter*

# Heartbeat Protocol
![[heartbeat protocol purpose.png]]
*The requirement for the exchange of a payload was designed into the Heartbeat
protocol to support its use in a connectionless version of TLS known as Datagram
Transport Layer Security (DTLS).*
